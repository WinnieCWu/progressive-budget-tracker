# What it is 
This update to an existing budget tracker app allows any user to have offline access and functionality. Users can add expenses or deposits with or without a connection. If there's no internet connection, the transactions will be saved and then updated once the user has =connection again. 

# Technologies used
IndexedDb and service workers were both used to enable offline functionality. Additionally, this app uses web-pack-dev server to test the service worker.
