# What it is 
This update to an existing budget tracker app allows any user to have offline access and functionality. Users can add or subtract funds both with and without a connection. If there's no internet connection, the transactions will be saved; when there is a connection, the saved data will be updated to the app automatically with the help of Service Worker.

# Technologies used
IndexedDb and service workers were both used to enable offline functionality. 

# What it looks like
